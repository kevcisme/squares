Superbowl Squares!
=================
Python script to help you and your friends play superbowl squares this Sunday.


What does this script do?
========================
It randomly generates the board (squares) and outputs it into a csv file
(i.e. it saves you the hassle of manual entry)

How do I use it?
=================
- Just edit the names and number of entries in the file and run it.
- The CSV file will be saved on your computer
- You can open it with excel or google docs
